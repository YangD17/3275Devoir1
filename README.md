Main: Takes the initial binary string and does a xor operation on first half and second half : FirstHalf xor SecondHalf

CribDrag:In theory, Xor binary string with another word in binary form which is concatenated to test the whole binary string, outputs the xor with different offsets, it offsets for the length of the crib word, example in text form:
thisisanexampleofthecodeintextform
thethethethethethethethethethethet

and then

thisisanexampleofthecodeintextform
 thethethethethethethethethethethe

in this example the offset would be of length 3 as "the" is 3 letters.

Only issue is
